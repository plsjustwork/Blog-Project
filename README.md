A small minimalist blog application where I use my newly acquired skills in integrating MYSQL and MVC architecture in apps for post/comment/like management from users. I used Model/Vue/Controller (MVC) architecture to divide the codes for each different layer.
It isn't role based, thus there are no admins, only users who are responsible for their own posts/comments/likes, It will be further improved in the future.
The SQL code to get the tables of the database is included in the files under the repository sql.

Thank you for checking it! The lack of documentation will be improvised in the future.
